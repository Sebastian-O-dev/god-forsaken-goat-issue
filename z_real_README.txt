INTRODUCTION

The "Monty Hall Problem" is a statistical issue created in the last century or so under a different name. Later, it was used in a game show as a question for the contestant to pick a door (as it is presented in the core problem itself). The counterintuitive answer, widely accepted by mathematical bodies - commonly rebutted by mathematicians including the most famous mathematicians of all time - is that switching doors is always statistically favoured once a door of the three containing a goat is revealed by the host.

IMPLEMENTATION

The pure goal of creating this script was to prove or disprove the given answer of always changing the door. The script was simply a tool that allowed for testing this hypothesis whilst being able to control all other variables. 

RESULTS

The test proved, that given a sample size of 6000 iterations, with 3000 being iterations with changing the door and 1000 iterations picking doors 1, 2 and 3 each, 3000 being iterations without changing the door and 1000 iterations picking doors 1, 2 and 3 each, it is twice as likely to pick a car when changing the door (~66% chance of winning the car when switching doors, ~33% chance of winning the car when not switching doors).
