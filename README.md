This whole conquest has been started by the mind-rotting, repeated YouTube short of Kevin Spacey — or some other XYZ list persona — acting as a professor during some quasi-mathematical lecture, being impressed by a young prodigy able to answer a complex logical question. I did this in part to spare the world the wrath my soul would unleash if I saw this aforementioned YouTube short again without attempting to disprove the explanation.

I repeatedly convinced myself that the explanation was surely flawed, without taking action. However, I have reached my breaking point. I told myself that the people who declare they seemingly understand the presented solution and agree with it are just morally corrupted liars or imbeciles. Maybe they, too, convince themselves of something far greater than themselves to avoid the outcome of truly confronting the issue.

My feeble mind has been plagued by the inconceivable, god-damned goat problem. A complex statistical question born—or if not born, at least nurtured—by such a shallow virtue as capitalism, being most renowned for appearing on some long-forgotten TV or radio game show. This nonexistent and redundant issue has a hold on me greater than I am willing to admit out of embarrassment. This puzzle or issue will, in almost all certainty, never be addressed again in the history of our existence as a civilization or even a race. How idiotic of me, in this moment, to even write that anything is certain or not — this whole issue proves that nothing is ever truly True or False.

The whole foundation of our perception of anything and everything, physical or metaphysical, is about the simplest True or False, if anything truly "is." If there is nothing, nothing can't be understood or perceived. Yet, we do perceive it — or we think so. We give ourselves puny symbols for anything and everything, as if they truly meant something to us. To find myself brought to my knees by a simple goat is enraging and, if anything, dangerous to the psyche and soul.

The issue humbles me greatly, reminding me of my mortality and foolishness. It's a problem truly only understandable by the Creator (if there is one). I couldn't bear the, at-the-time obvious, mistake held within the solution. In the Faustian rapidness and gluttony, I have gambled my sanity in a bid to disprove the solution. The answer satisfies those who have accepted statistics, probability, and mathematics as a whole, as the objective and unmistakable language of describing and explaining all that is — well, is. Can one truly even conceive of true wholeness? Like the number one. Just fully complete without any missing pieces, atoms, or thoughts? I have been cursed with the need for completeness and with the human ability (are most all people) to know what I do not know, or better yet, what is truly unattainable.

The answer is 2/3 to 1/3 in favor of switching doors. Blasphemy. The issue is no more a statistical issue than Schrödinger's cat. The answer must be brought onto a theoretical plane, on which mathematics evolves into a tool for philosophical discourse. The answer must be greater than the one or zero, or even the equals sign it concludes with. Just as the tangent function never reaches zero — apparently also taken as a fact, even though our minds could never grasp infinity infinitely approaching zero — maybe this issue lies on said zero, never truly belonging to one part of the world or the other. It is something more, a combination of the two, or something even greater than that. Something that transcends what we know as of now, or maybe what we will ever know.

I refuse this explanation. No one owes me a different one. There has to be more. I refute the argument that it's cold, simple mathematics — or ones and zeros. Maybe everything is ones and zeros, and this small part, which was the most beneficial for us to name and organize, was accepted, while many others were cast out as it wounds our collective ego. Something we lie to ourselves about to keep happy or fulfilled. Keep the car and the forsaken goats. I don't want them; I never did.

Maybe it's my mortal ego. Maybe it is as simple as it is presented and obvious — it's 2/3 in favor of switching. Just maybe I can't bear the thought of truly comprehending this issue, or worse yet, accepting my intellectual inferiority. Could it be called inferiority if the sole criteria of inferiority are questioned?

This isn't a manifesto. This is a cry for help or for pity. This isn't even closure. This is catharsis.
